# Challenge-2-Portfolio

This challenge focused on putting your HTML and CSS skills to the test. For this project I created my starter portfolio, which will eventually serve as
a showcase for my work throughout this course and beyond. The foundation for the portfolio was started using HTML by organizing semantic elements, including images and 
corresponding alt tags, and ensuring use of appropiate links. The HTML is link to a stylesheet which uses a varieties of rules and elements to enhance the visuals. Incorporated 
are many instances using flex properties.
